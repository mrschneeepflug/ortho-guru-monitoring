# Go-To-Market Strategy

## 1. Positioning

> "Remote orthodontic monitoring that works today — no AI black box, no enterprise contract. Your clinical judgment, better tools."

### Core Message

You've heard of remote monitoring. You know it saves chair time and patients love it. But DentalMonitoring wants €62,500 upfront and a 250-patient minimum.

OrthoMonitor gives you the same core capability — patients scan at home, you review on your dashboard — for €99/month with no upfront cost and no minimum. Start with 10 patients this week.

## 2. Target Market

### Primary: Underserved Independent Practices

- Solo practitioners (1 doctor, 30–100 patients)
- Small group practices (2–3 doctors, 100–250 patients)
- Practices in smaller markets / rural areas
- Practices already doing aligner treatments but without monitoring tech

### Why This Segment

- ~70–80% of all orthodontic practices
- Completely priced out of DentalMonitoring
- Want remote monitoring but can't justify enterprise commitment
- Value clinical control and simplicity over AI automation
- Strong word-of-mouth networks (study clubs, conferences, local communities)

## 5. Sales Messaging

### Key Differentiators to Communicate

| Point | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Price | "90% cheaper than DentalMonitoring." |
| Flexibility | "No minimum patients, no long-term contract, cancel anytime." |
| Clinical Control | "You review every scan. No AI making decisions for you." |
| Documentation | "Structured clinical records you've never had before." |
| Future-proof | "When our AI is ready, you get it first — trained on real data from real orthodontists." |

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|---------|
| "No AI? How is this better than photos over WhatsApp?" | Guided scanning workflow ensures consistent quality. Structured tagging creates searchable clinical records. Compliance tracking tells you who's scanning and who's not. Secure messaging is HIPAA-compliant. And it all feeds into a dashboard designed for batch review — not a chat thread. |
| "I'll wait for you to add AI." | The manual tool already reduces in-person visits and improves patient communication. Plus, early adopters who tag consistently will get AI features first (and at the best price). |
| "DentalMonitoring has FDA clearance." | Our manual tool doesn't need FDA clearance — you're making all the clinical decisions. When we add AI, it'll be positioned as clinical decision support with doctor confirmation, not autonomous decision-making. |
| "Will this integrate with my PMS?" | Dolphin and OrthoTrac integrations planned for Phase 3 (month 6–12). Which system do you use? |
