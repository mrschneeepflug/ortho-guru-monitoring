# Competitive Analysis: DentalMonitoring & Market Landscape

## 1. DentalMonitoring Overview

DentalMonitoring (DM) is a Paris-based company, founded in 2014 by Philippe Salah, that created the world's first AI-powered remote orthodontic monitoring platform. As of early 2026, DM is the dominant incumbent in this space.

### Key Facts

- **Valuation / Funding:** Secured $100M in combined investment (February 2026) led by Lazard Elaia Capital. Previously raised significant rounds. Total investment to date: €150M+.
- **Scale:** 2M+ patients, 500+ employees, 18 countries, 9 offices.
- **Technology:** AI-powered SaaS platform analyzing intraoral photos. Tracks 130+ oral observations. 21 indications cleared as medical device under FDA and EU MDR.
- **Data Moat:** Largest dental image database in the industry (2 billion+ images).
- **IP:** 470+ patents and pending applications. Actively enforcing patents via litigation.
- **Regulatory:** FDA De Novo approval. EU MDR Class IIa CE marking (achieved 2024, four years ahead of deadline).

### What DM Does

1. **Patient App:** Patients use a proprietary ScanBox device + smartphone to take guided intraoral scans at a frequency set by the doctor.
2. **AI Analysis:** Platform analyzes, sorts, and crops images automatically. AI detects and monitors 130+ oral observations.
3. **Doctor Dashboard:** Doctors receive AI-driven clinical updates, notifications, and protocol-based workflow automation.
4. **Communication:** Automated notifications and in-app messaging between patients and practices.
5. **GoLive System:** Patented algorithm that determines whether an aligner is properly seated ("Go") or not ("No-Go"), enabling remote aligner advancement decisions.

### DM Product Suite

| Product | Function |
|---------|----------|
| DentalMonitoring | Core remote monitoring platform |
| SmileMate | Patient lead engagement, triage, and conversion |
| Vision | AI-generated reporting and smile simulations |
| ScanBox Pro | Proprietary hardware for consistent intraoral scanning |

## 2. DentalMonitoring Pricing Intelligence

**Source:** Direct market intelligence from orthodontic practices.

### Pricing Structure

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Upfront per-patient fee | ~€250 per patient |
| Minimum patient commitment | 250 patients |
| **Minimum upfront investment** | **€62,500+** |
| Monthly platform fee | Undisclosed (significant) |
| Monthly per-patient fee | Undisclosed |
| Contract length | Multi-year typical |
| ScanBox hardware | Proprietary, required |

### What This Means

The €62,500+ entry barrier locks out the vast majority of orthodontic practices worldwide. Most practices have fewer than 250 active monitoring cases. They cannot justify this investment regardless of clinical value.

**This is our primary market opportunity.**

## 3. Market Segmentation

| Segment | Practice Size | Active Cases | DM Viable? | OrthoMonitor Fit |
|---------|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Solo Practitioner | 1 doctor | 30–100 | No (below minimum) | Ideal — Starter tier |
| Small Group | 2–3 doctors | 100–250 | Borderline | Ideal — Professional tier |
| Mid-Size Practice | 3–6 doctors | 200–500 | Yes, but expensive | Strong — Professional tier |
| Large / DSO | 6+ doctors | 500+ | Yes (target customer) | Competitive — Enterprise tier |

Solo practitioners and small groups represent ~70–80% of all orthodontic practices in Europe and North America. This is the underserved majority.

## 4. Competitive Positioning

### Why DentalMonitoring Can't Easily Compete on Price

DM's business model is built on high per-patient margins. Dropping their price to match a €99/month flat rate would:

1. **Cannibalize existing revenue** from enterprise customers paying €250/patient
2. **Undermine their sales narrative** of premium AI-powered analysis
3. **Require restructuring** their entire pricing model and sales org
4. **Signal weakness** to investors who just committed $100M

This is a classic innovator's dilemma. DM is structurally locked into premium pricing.

### Our Competitive Advantages

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Price** | 90% cheaper entry. No €62,500 upfront, no minimums. |
| **Flexibility** | Month-to-month. Start with 5 patients or 500. |
| **Clinical control** | Doctor reviews everything. No AI black box. |
| **Documentation** | Structured clinical tagging system (unique value). |
| **Trust** | Many orthodontists are skeptical of AI decisions. We embrace that. |
| **Simplicity** | No proprietary hardware required. Generic cheek retractors. |

### Our Competitive Disadvantages (vs. DM)

| Disadvantage | Mitigation |
|--------------|-----------|
| No AI analysis at launch | Positioned as feature, not bug. AI comes in Phase 2. |
| No FDA-cleared indications | Manual tool doesn't need FDA. AI will need regulatory path. |
| No brand recognition | Start with founder's network. Build case studies early. |
| Smaller team / resources | Lean MVP. Revenue from early customers funds growth. |
| No ScanBox-quality imaging | On-device quality validation. Good enough for manual review. |

## 5. Other Competitors

### Grin (Get-Grin)

- Remote dental monitoring with a smaller funnel-style device (not a box)
- DM sued Grin for patent infringement (2022 and 2023 — both hardware and software patents)
- Grin stated they would "vigorously fight" the lawsuits
- Smaller player, US-focused

### Align Technology (Invisalign) — Virtual Care AI

- Built-in remote monitoring for Invisalign patients
- DM sued Align for patent infringement (November 2022, three patents)
- Case still active (appeal at Federal Circuit as of 2025)
- Only works with Invisalign — not appliance-agnostic

### Other Players

- **TeleDent:** Teledentistry platform, broader than orthodontics
- **SmileSnap:** Virtual consultation tool, not monitoring
- **Various telehealth platforms:** General telemedicine, not specialized for orthodontic monitoring

### Competitive Landscape Summary

DM dominates. Align has a captive solution for their own aligners. Grin is small and under legal pressure. The mid-market (affordable, appliance-agnostic, manual-first monitoring) is essentially **unoccupied territory**.
